## Data Analysis and Visualization Project Details

With your pod group, you’ll create a brief and comprehensive presentation showcasing your observations, insights, and recommendations from a data set provided to you, or one of your choosing for a mock client. 

Each pod member should contribute to the introduction and conclusion and is responsible for creating at least one slide showing a data visualization AND an observation or insight.

Pods will present the presentation in front of the class, captains, and members of HQ. There’s no slide limit, but the presentation should be < 15 minutes.

Each Pod within each Cohort must choose a dataset that is unique from other Pods within the same Cohort. You may select your own dataset outside of the four preselected datasets if the dataset is over 500 rows of data and approved by your pod captain or program manager. 

### Dataset Guidelines

- Datasets must be over 500 rows 
  - *Note:* adding different data sets together doesn’t count
- Project should be **fairly original**; the more common/general the problem, the harder it will be to make original insights 
  - *E.g.*, topics like voter turnout, political patterns, COVID, etc. are all commonly studied topics (by big-time data scientists), so it will be difficult to a) not be influenced by their conclusions, and b) interpret the data through an original lens and come up with novel recommendations
- Data should be as **specific** as possible
  - *E.g.*, if you’re looking at high school graduation rates, look at the county level instead of the national level
- **Bonus challenge:** Scrape your own data! (If you have the know-how!)

## NBA Tempo & Injuries: Analyzing the Effects on Performance and Winnings

## Brief

For our pod, we decided to choose a dataset outside of the preselected datasets and perform our data analysis on National Basketball Association (NBA) game statistics. We developed the data analysis project to analyze the impact of tempo and injuries on the performance of 30 NBA teams. We also explored the patterns and relationships between pace, possessions, number of injured players, number of games missed, earned while injured, average speed, and average distance with championship winnings.
