## **Overview**

As a Lead Captain, I optimized the Capstone Project curriculum using R and Tableau by creating an additional dataset, a mock final deliverable, and instructor training resources that ensured consistent implementation across 22 cohorts. I led four solo Tableau refresher sessions for over 140 students, reviewing visualization and dashboard design concepts, which resulted in a 90% improvement in proficiency based on feedback and project completion rates. I also facilitated two SQL training sessions using Jupyter Notebook with DuckDB, providing an interactive walkthrough that helped more than 135 students strengthen their query-writing skills through a “solve the mystery” assignment. In addition, I conducted a solo Excel workshop for 20 students on XLOOKUP as a modern alternative to VLOOKUP, enhancing lookup accuracy and overall data efficiency.

## **Repository Purpose**

This repository showcases the original instructional materials I developed and refined during my captainship at COOP Careers. I streamlined the Capstone Project for multiple NYC Data Analytics cohorts (Fall 2024, Spring 2025, and Fall 2025) by expanding and restructuring the provided dataset, allowing fellows to practice JOINs and VLOOKUPs and to generate deeper, more meaningful insights and visualizations. I also created mock final deliverables and slide decks to guide consistent expectations and improve data storytelling across projects.

Beyond the Capstone materials, I designed original training decks for Tableau review sessions, as well as for XLOOKUP and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) lessons. I also adapted the SQL Murder Mystery Google Colab notebook into a more approachable format, breaking queries down step-by-step to make the learning process easier to follow and understand. Together, these materials supported consistent instruction, skill mastery, and greater project quality across all cohorts.
