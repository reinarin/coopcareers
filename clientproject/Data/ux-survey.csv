6/6/2022 21:39,3,3,2,3,One suggestion is to review spelling to ensure the website feels professional.
6/6/2022 22:07,5,5,2,3,"Website is clear and concise, however, some bits could do with some proofreading."

6/6/2022 23:28,5,5,1,5,
6/7/2022 0:32,5,4,3,4,Maybe more information on cybersecurity careers and the different industries to work in. Growth prospects. Popular tools. Maybe some guest articles by people in the fields. 
6/7/2022 9:55,5,4,3,4,"Perhaps anchor the ""start here"" heading of the drop-down menu somewhere on the home page. I wasn't sure what the purpose of the website was until after I read the mission statement therein. it wasn't intuitive to read all the article headings on the home page first. "
6/7/2022 10:45,2,3,2,1,Include a brief description of each resource link.
6/7/2022 11:04,3,4,2,3,
6/7/2022 12:52,1,3,3,3,"Change the ""Start Here"" tab name to be ""About"" or something similar"
6/7/2022 12:55,1,1,3,1,"Everything, It doesn't look like a reputable site "
6/7/2022 13:05,2,5,1,3,The landing page should probably be the “start here” page. That gives me the info I need to know about the website that the current page isn’t telling. I would’ve clicked off if I didn’t see the “start here” on the menu.
6/7/2022 13:08,5,5,1,4,"I think the content is fine, the site is just not 100% functional yet. It's pretty fluid but the 'Podcast' tab seems to take a bit to load. Additionally, the main page displays news so it may be confusing for first-time visitors as to what the purpose of the site is. I think the ""Start Here"" tab should be the first things users see. "
6/7/2022 13:11,5,5,4,5,
6/7/2022 13:16,3,2,2,1,"Change the UI of the home landing page to be less wordy. At first sight, it looks like a blog."
6/7/2022 13:22,4,4,1,4,If the landing page wasn't a blog. I assumed it was a purely a cyber security personal blog. Something about the collective resources they have would of been cool. That was my favorite section of the website
6/7/2022 13:32,4,2,3,3,State most common links to the site( in refrence to what people most commonly search for when using the site or more user friendly for new users) along with mission statement and purpose in the landing page. 
6/7/2022 13:40,2,3,1,1,"Spell/grammar Check. The Start Here was confusing, versus like About Us or How We Started"
6/7/2022 13:45,3,5,4,3,"Have the ""Start here"" tab be the home page, instead of all of the articles currently on the homepage or rename that tab ""About AccessCyber""; minimize white space around the header image, make sure the header image is crisp (it's a bit grainy/blurry)"

6/7/2022 13:52,5,5,3,5,N/A
6/7/2022 13:57,3,3,1,2,"A noticed a typo, on the landing page below where it says ""State of Cybersecurity Education (2022)"", it says ""We even mad a few predictions for what’s in store, such as the MISP"", and I think it's supposed to say ""we even MADE"""
6/7/2022 14:06,3,4,3,3,N/A
6/7/2022 14:21,5,4,2,5,"For easier reading, it would be nice if the listings under each subheading in the Resources tab were in a bigger font!"
6/7/2022 14:26,4,5,1,3,None 
6/7/2022 14:28,1,5,2,3,Very wordy. Get to the point.
6/7/2022 14:28,5,4,1,3,
6/7/2022 14:41,4,4,3,3,More section usage with shorter word headlines that can be clicked through to read. It would make the front page look sleeker and neater.
6/7/2022 14:45,5,5,5,5,
6/7/2022 15:34,1,1,4,1,The UX on mobile is very confusing. It's not clear what is a link to click on. It's also not clear what is a title to a post or if something is a banner advertisment. 
6/7/2022 15:59,5,4,1,4,Possibly having each categories within Cybersecurity Career & Education Resources having their own tab. I found all the information being on the same page a bit overwhelming.
6/7/2022 16:23,5,5,5,5,"Personally I wouldn’t change anything. At the moment it seems to be very direct and to the point. It was an enjoyable experience. If I wanted to be picky I’d say the word “Cyber” is used a bit too much, but it’s a cyber security website! So that’s probably a silly thing to say."
6/7/2022 16:23,3,4,5,3,The homepage can be categorized/organized better. I couldn’t tell if the top part was a description of the site or a link to an article since there’s many listed under. I would suggest to highlight the one of the day and then have a link to go out to the full article pages instead of having a lot to scroll once I click on the link.

6/7/2022 18:33,5,5,1,3,its perfect cheers m8
6/7/2022 18:49,5,5,1,3,Nightmode for better visibility and I feel like resources tab can be separated into different categories with a short summary of what the resource has to offer.
6/7/2022 19:08,2,2,2,1,
6/7/2022 19:46,5,5,1,3,Updating the overall ux design. The current look is OK but could definitely use an design update to increase the overall user experience
6/7/2022 20:04,2,4,2,3,
6/7/2022 20:25,2,2,4,3,"Too much happening on the landing page. Descriptors are too vague and there is no action for me to take immediately. Since things are too vague and there is no action prompting me, I do not feel compelled to stay on the page. Would be more effective with a banner w/ hero image + a 'Start Here' button (rather than a navigation link that is not immediately noticeable). You have to give users direction and directives to your content fast or you lose their attention."

6/8/2022 9:35,4,5,3,4,Some typos were spotted at the top of the page
6/8/2022 11:01,5,5,4,4,
6/8/2022 13:26,3,4,2,4,"There's a lot going on, lots of links, etc. but I appreciated the ""Start Here"" tab which was a clear place to start and the other tabs seem pretty straight forward (e.g. resources, careers) although it does look like there's no current open roles on the careers tab"
6/8/2022 15:32,5,5,2,3,"Everything seems great. I guess I would add a bit more visuals or maybe like a road map for the ""start here"" page so instead of listing it's like step by step, it would make it a little more interactive? But everything else seems great!!"
6/8/2022 16:30,1,1,2,1,professional website ux/ui design revamp.
6/8/2022 20:50,2,2,3,2,the content is not engaging.
