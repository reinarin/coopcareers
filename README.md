## [**COOP Careers**](https://coopcareers.org/) [Data Analytics Apprenticeship](https://coopcareers.org/data-analytics)

Building a diverse movement of upwardly mobile college grads overcoming underemployment through digital skills and peer connections.

**Mission:** Overcoming underemployment through digital skills and peer connections.

**Peer Cohorts:** Careers are a team sport at COOP ("ko-op"). Together for 200 hours, local grads learn digital skills, build community, and pursue full-time offers in [Digital Marketing](https://coopcareers.org/digital-marketing), [Data Analytics](https://coopcareers.org/data-analytics) or [Tech Sales](https://coopcareers.org/tech-sales).

**Cohort Captains:** Our cohorts are led by peer Captains; four COOP alumni who guide each cohort through the entire program, *paying it forward* while growing as leaders.

**Feature Partners:** Ultimately, COOP is connective tissue—between people and opportunities, but also between great public institutions and [private companies](https://coopcareers.org/partners). We're honored to partner with CUNY, Google, Microsoft, and many more.
